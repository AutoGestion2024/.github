## Project description
The project involves developing an Android application dedicated to managing automobiles in a garage. The application allows users to scan vehicle license plates to simplify the addition of new vehicles to the garage's database or to search for vehicles that are already registered. In addition to this, the application offers advanced features for managing repairs, ordered parts, and invoices associated with the vehicles.

The main objective is to centralize and digitize the management of vehicle and customer data, thereby making the process more efficient, faster, and less prone to human error.

## Features
- OCR reading of license plate
- Creation of the form : driver information, vehicle information, photo of the vehicle registration, description of the breakdown, related invoices
- Adding photos to the form
- Displaying data from a car profile
- Search in the vehicle list or add a new vehicle via license plate reader
- Modification/deletion of a profile
- Information on the invoice status
- Specific search to find vehicle information
- Transfer of information to another phone
